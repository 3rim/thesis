# thesis
This project was developed as a bachelor's thesis at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamburg (HAW).

## Abstract
In this work, a full stack application is developed, which in the context of a neighborhood
school aims to ensure the inventory management of physical media (books, iPads, laptops, etc.) and their lending and return. The application has a classic client-server architecture.
The backend is implemented using Spring Boot and the resulting REST API is secured
with Spring Security. Vue.js is used as a frontend framework and Tailwind CSS as an open
source CSS framework for the frontend. The work describes the requirements analysis,
specification, design and implementation.
